This toolkil provides a simple (single process) application to test and understand
overlay networks. Through these examples, you should construct different network
configurations (e.g., hub-spoke, bus, ring, tree) and understand how messages
flow between the nodes (vertices). 

Some questions (not all) to consider:

1. How many hops does a message travel? Can it be improved?
2. Failure and recovery with the lost of a node. How does the network handle failures?
3. Redundant paths. How does he network handle cycles?




4. Implement TTL, heartbeat, vector clocks, authentication.
