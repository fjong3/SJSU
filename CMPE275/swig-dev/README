Build and install pcre and swig from the uploaded files.

Notes:
1. substitute '*' for correct version [file]
2. I used xcode to build and install swig as I ran into an issue with gcc-6.1

Install example:
0. mkdir /usr/local/swig
1. mkdir swig-dev
2. copy contents of lab to swig-dev. (e.g., cp swig* pcre* swig-dev/.)
3. cd swig-dev
4. build and install pcre and swig. For example:
   a. untar swig*
   b. cp build-*.sh swig-*/
   c. cd swig-*
   d. untar ../pcre-*   
   e. cp build-pcre.sh pcre-*
   f. run script to build and install
   g. cd ..
   h. run and install swig
