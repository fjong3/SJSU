This is our first introduction to parallel coding using directive-based coding.

Requirements:

   gcc/g++ 6.1
   CMake


To compile:

   [prompt]: mkdir build
   [prompt]: cd build
   [prompt]: cmake ..


To run:

   1) Look at the code and see what you think will be outputted to the screen.

   2) Run the code
   
     [prompt]: ./[exe_name]

   3) Try changing the number of threads and run again

     [prompt]: OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./[exe_name]

   4) Measure time to execute (wallclock)

     [prompt]: time OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./[exe_name]


To cleanup:

    [prompt] rm -rf build
